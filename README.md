An android notes app which is location aware and is speech enabled.

creation of the app can be done in 3 phases
	- A simple note taking application
	- Enabling text to speech in the application
	- Associating location with notes and making it location aware
		- Will look at google maps aPI integration etc


Timing wise
	- Note taking app - done latest by Nov 10th
	- Voice enabling - nov 25th
	- Basic location enabling - Dec 1st
	- Optional google map integration by Dec 15th
	
Should aim to hit playstore around Dec 20th, in the producitity apps category to cashin the xmas/newyear timing
